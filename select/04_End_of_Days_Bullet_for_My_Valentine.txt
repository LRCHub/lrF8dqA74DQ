We're wasting precious time
The clock is ticking
Can you hear the countdown
With every hour
Give me the power
I need the strength to carry on
On and on
No more I care to live
When I'm just born to die
We're all born to die
Born to die [x2]
Never before, never again
Behold this travesty
Never before, never again
Behold adversary [x2]
Befriend my enemies
My pulse is racing
I can hear my heart beat
Is this the last time
You get to be mine
I lack the will to carry on
On and on
No more I care to live
When I'm just born to die
We're all born to die
Born to die [x2]
Never before, never again
Behold this travesty
Never before, never again
Behold adversary [x2]
No more sorrows, no tomorrow's
I've never felt alive before
With every hour
Give me the power
I need the strength to carry on
On and on
No more I care to live
When I'm just born to die
We're all born to die
Born to die [x3]
No more I care to live
When I'm just born to die
Born to die
To die [x3]
