I've had enough, I'll make 'em see
They'll never take another drop of blood from me
And judge you all, one final bow
I'll be your end of days
Blood in the streets, the royals fall
I will do what I must until I see them crawl up to me
Where they will see, I'll be your end of days

I'll be your end of days
Black-robed judges bring the gavel down, goodbye

Tell me all the ways that I went wrong
They'd lock us up forever, given half a chance
Out of sight, out of mind, same old dance

Keep the rebels down, kill their every sound
The more you try to silence me, the more I'm gaining ground

I've had enough, I'll make 'em see
They'll never take another drop of blood from me

And judge you all, one final bow
I'll be your end of days

Blood in the streets, the royals fall
I will do what I must until I see them crawl up to me
Where they will see, I'll be your end of days

I'll be your end of days

Painted smile, glad hands, pick your pocket, money gone
Laughing to themselves, and forget your name
Make up any promise as they go and sell your future
We all had a vote, tell me who's to blame
Keep the rebels down, kill their every sound
The more you try to silence me, the more I'm gaining ground
I've had enough, I'll make 'em see
They'll never take another drop of blood from me
And judge you all, one final bow
I'll be your end of days

Blood in the streets, the royals fall
I will do what I must until I see them crawl up to me
Where they will see, I'll be your end of days
I'll be your end of days
