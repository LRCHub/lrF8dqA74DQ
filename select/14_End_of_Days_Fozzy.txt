What happened to all of us?
The things we say, our evil ways
Who can we really trust?
Our lies and betrayal, is why we fail

Can you believe in love?
Lost in this world
Can you believe in love?
And it's not too late

End of days, and there's a full moon rising
End of days, and there's a full moon rising, again...

Who are you, Do you really know?
What you've to become, Hollow and numb
The sickness, it eats away, all of your dreams
That's how it feels

Can you believe in love?
Lost in this world
Can you believe in love?
And it's not too late

End of days, and there's a full moon rising
End of days and there's a full moon rising

Can you believe in love? Lost in this world
Can you believe in love? And it's not too late
Can you believe in love? Lost in this world
Can you believe in love? And it's not too late

End of days, and there's a full moon rising
End of days, and there's a full moon rising
End of days, and there's a full moon rising
End of days, and there's a full moon rising
Can you believe in love?
