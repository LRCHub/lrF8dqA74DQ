Has it all been an empty gesture?
Has it all been a waste of time?
The world's spinning into certain disaster
We never figured out the meaning of life

Don't wait to say what's on your mind
Don't take it with you, leave it behind

There's a fire in the sky
There's chaos in the air tonight
Stay with me, don't run away
Let's sit back and watch the end of days
Sit back and watch the end of days
Sit back and watch the end of days

Tomorrow there will be an empty skyline
Where all our monuments used to be
Piles of steel and worthless plastic
All we built swallowed up by the sea

Your gold and your fame won't save you now
Say your goodbyes, it's all coming down
